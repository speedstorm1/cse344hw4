a.

R(A, B, C, D, E)
    Because the closure of B is {BD} this violates BCNF as B, D is not a superkey. Thus we split into the following:
R1(A, B, C, E), R2(B, D)
    Because the closure of CE (within R1) is {ACE}, this also violates BCNF, as ACE is not a superkey. Thus, we split R1:
R1.1(B, C, E), R1.2(A, C, E), R2(B, D)
    Because all three subtables satisfy BCNF, this is the final decomposition of R.


b.

S(A, B, C, D, E)
    Because the closure of A is AE, this violates BCNF as AE is not a superkey. Thus we split into the following:
S1(A, B, C, D), S2(A, E)
    Because the closure of BC (in S1) is BCA, this violates BCNF as BCA is not a superkey. Thus, we split S1:
S1.1(B, C, D), S1.2(B, C, A), S2(A, E)
    Because all three subtables satisfy BCNF, this is the final decomposition of S.

d. 

A -> ABCD
B -> ABCD
C -> ABCD 
D -> ABCD

e.

B -> BC 
C -> BC 
D -> ABCD
